# Operational Efficiency and Quality Control Optimization using Tableau for LPQA

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on improving operational efficiency and quality control at **Little Panda Quality Analysis (LPQA)** by analyzing defect rates in automotive component inspections. Through data analysis and visualizations created in Tableau, the project identifies key factors—such as training, tool calibration, and tool usage—that influence defect rates. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help LPQA reduce defects, optimize processes, and cut operational costs.

## **Project Objectives**
- **Analyze Defect Rates**: Investigate the causes of high defect rates using the provided dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Tableau to create interactive visualizations that highlight the relationships between defect rates, training levels, calibration frequency, and tool usage.
- **Optimize Operations**: Provide recommendations to improve quality control through better training and calibration practices, aiming to reduce defects and cut rework costs.

## **Features**
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Conducted an analysis to uncover the main drivers behind high defect rates.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Built interactive and dynamic visualizations in Tableau, including:
  - Defect Rate by Part code and Training Level (Bar Chart)
  - Experience Level and Training level vs. Defect Rate (Stacked Bar Chart)
  - Calibration Frequency Impact on Defects (Line Graph)
  - Tool Usage vs. Defect Count (Pie Chart)
  - Calibration Count vs. Defect Count for Parts (Line Graph)
- **Operational Insights**: Identified key operational improvements such as standardizing training and increasing tool calibration frequency.

## **Data Analysis in Tableau**
- **Data Import**: The dataset was imported into Tableau for exploration and visualization.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Used Tableau's analytics tools to calculate summary statistics and uncover trends in the data.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Developed dashboards with filters and drill-down options to enable dynamic analysis and deeper insights.

## **Visualizations**
The project uses various Tableau visualizations to explore and communicate findings:
1. **Defect Rate by Part code and Training Level**: Bar Chart highlighting the correlation between part codes, experience levels, and training effectiveness.
2. **Tools Used vs Defect Count**: Pie Chart showing the proportion of defects attributed to specific tools used during the inspections.
3. **Impact of Calibration on Total Defects by Part**: Line Graph showing how increasing calibration frequency reduces defects across different parts.
4. **Training and Experience Impact on Defects**: Bar Chart comparing defect counts based on standardized vs. non-standardized training.
5. **Calibration Count vs Total Defect Count for Parts**: Line Graph that reveals how calibration frequency impacts the overall defect count for each part code.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted using Tableau for data visualization, exploration, and insight generation.
- **Data Preparation**: Used Excel for any preliminary data cleaning before importing into Tableau.
- **Documentation**: This README and additional project reports are written in Markdown and Word for clarity.

## **Installation and Setup**
1. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure that the dataset (defects_data.csv) is available in the project directory.
2. **Open Tableau**: Load the dataset into Tableau to start creating visualizations.
3. **Explore the Dashboard**: Use the interactive filters and drill-downs to analyze relationships between defect rates and various operational factors.

## **How to Use the Tableau Dashboards**
- **Filters**: Explore the dashboards using filters (e.g., by training level, experience, or tool usage) to dive deeper into the data.
- **Hover Tooltips**: Hover over data points to see additional details and insights.
- **Interactive Drill-Downs**: Use drill-down features to explore specific areas of interest, such as part code, training level, or calibration frequency.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Standardized Training Reduces Defects**: Parts that undergo standardized training consistently exhibit fewer defects. Standardized training leads to better performance, as highlighted by the data showing a reduction in defect rates for operators with standardized training.
2. **Frequent Tool Calibration Improves Quality**: The data shows that parts inspected with tools calibrated more frequently experience fewer defects. Regular calibration is linked to improved inspection accuracy and reduced rework.
3. **Inexperience Contributes to Higher Defects**: Inexperienced operators, particularly those without standardized training, contribute to a higher number of defects. Targeted training and support can help reduce these defect rates.
4. **Tool Usage Correlation**: The analysis of tool usage reveals that more tools do not necessarily reduce defects. Focus should instead be on proper calibration and effective operator training.
5. **Calibration Frequency Lowers Defect Counts**: The analysis reveals that parts like B and D, which had higher calibration frequencies, saw a significant decrease in overall defect counts. Increasing calibration frequency across all parts will lead to better quality control outcomes.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how Tableau can be used to perform effective data visualization and analysis for operational improvements. By optimizing training and calibration schedules, LPQA can reduce defects, lower costs, and improve overall efficiency.
