# Operational Efficiency and Quality Control Optimization using Tableau for LPQA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on improving operational efficiency and quality control at **Little Panda Quality Analysis (LPQA)** by analyzing defect rates in automotive component inspections. Through data analysis and **visualizations created in Tableau**, the project identifies key factors—such as training, tool calibration, and tool usage—that influence defect rates. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help LPQA reduce defects, optimize processes, and cut operational costs.

## Project Objectives
- **Analyze Defect Rates**: Investigate the causes of high defect rates using the **5-Whys** method.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Tableau to create interactive visualizations that highlight the relationships between defect rates, training levels, calibration frequency, and tool usage.
- **Optimize Operations**: Provide recommendations to improve quality control through better training and calibration practices, aiming to reduce defects by **42%** and cut rework costs by **20%**.

## Features
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Conducted a **5-Whys** analysis to uncover the main drivers behind high defect rates.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Built interactive and dynamic visualizations in Tableau, including:
  - Defect Rate by Training Level (Bar Chart)
  - Experience Level vs. Defect Rate (Stacked Bar Chart)
  - Calibration Frequency Impact on Defects (Line Graph)
  - Tool Usage vs. Defect Count (Box Plot)
  - Projected Cost Savings from Training (Pie Chart)
- **Operational Insights**: Identified key operational improvements such as standardizing training and increasing tool calibration frequency.

## Data Analysis in Tableau
- **Data Import**: The dataset (synthetic_defects_data.csv) was imported into Tableau for exploration and visualization.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Used Tableau's analytics tools to calculate summary statistics and uncover trends in the data.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Developed dashboards with filters and drill-down options to enable dynamic analysis and deeper insights.

## Visualizations
The project uses various Tableau visualizations to explore and communicate findings:
- **Defect Rate by Training**: Bar Chart showing the impact of standardized vs. non-standardized training on defect rates.
- **Experience vs. Defects**: Stacked Bar Chart displaying the correlation between experience levels and defect rates.
- **Calibration Frequency Impact**: Line Graph illustrating how tool calibration frequency reduces defect rates.
- **Tool Usage and Defects**: Box Plot showing the distribution of defect counts based on the number of tools used.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted using **Tableau** for data visualization, exploration, and insight generation.
- **Data Preparation**: Used Excel for any preliminary data cleaning before importing into Tableau.
- **Documentation**: This README and additional project reports are written in Markdown and Word for clarity.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Download the Dataset**: Ensure that the dataset (synthetic_defects_data.csv) is available in the project directory.
2. **Open Tableau**: Load the dataset into Tableau to start creating visualizations.
3. **Explore the Dashboard**: Use the interactive filters and drill-downs to analyze relationships between defect rates and various operational factors.

## How to Use the Tableau Dashboards
- **Filters**: Explore the dashboards using filters (e.g., by training level, experience, or tool usage) to dive deeper into the data.
- **Hover Tooltips**: Hover over data points to see additional details and insights.
- **Interactive Drill-Downs**: Use drill-down features to explore specific areas of interest, such as part code, training level, or calibration frequency.

## Key Insights
1. **Standardized Training Reduces Defects**: Standardized training leads to a **42% reduction in defects**, highlighting the importance of proper training programs.
2. **Frequent Tool Calibration Improves Quality**: Tools calibrated at least 3 times a year show a **25% decrease in defects**, demonstrating the value of regular maintenance.
3. **No Direct Correlation Between Tool Usage and Defects**: The analysis shows that simply increasing the number of tools used does not lead to fewer defects; focus should be on training and calibration.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Tableau** can be used to perform effective data visualization and analysis for operational improvements. By optimizing training and calibration schedules, LPQA can reduce defects, lower costs, and improve overall efficiency.
